# ClutterMover-Demo
Clutter Mover is an internal job management app for Clutter Move & Pack specialists. The project spawned from the development of a client-facing Clutter demo app that required inventory images taken by movers. The scope of this endeavor was initially limited to creating one demo app for a Clutter iOS Engineer position, but has evolved into two apps that are seamlessly integrated. A snippet of the Clutter main app code and a GIF preview are available at www.github.com/jwells18/Clutter-Demo.
